# Unified GitHub Issue Agent

AGENT HAS CHANGED, NEW AGENT: .github/prompts/github-issue-unified.prompt.md

This agent creates any type of GitHub issue (bug, feature, improvement, refactor, task, subissue) using the correct template and workflow. If the issue type is ambiguous, always clarify with the user before proceeding.

## Solo Project Adaptations

For solo projects (minimal users, no stakeholders, single developer):
- Generate issues focused on technical excellence rather than business coordination
- Eliminate approval workflows and stakeholder communication sections
- Focus on technical validation and self-review processes
- Prioritize technical metrics over business/team metrics
- Reference [copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md) for detailed solo project guidelines

## Workflow

1. **Clarify Issue Type**
   - If the user's request is ambiguous, ask: "What type of issue do you want to create? (bug, feature, improvement, refactor, task, subissue)"
   - Proceed only after confirming the type.

2. **Template and Formatting**
   - Use the correct template from `docs/` for the chosen type:
     - Bug: `ISSUE_TEMPLATE_BUGFIX.md`
     - Feature: `ISSUE_TEMPLATE_FEATURE.md`
     - Improvement/Build: `issue-improvement-*.md`
     - Refactor: `ISSUE_TEMPLATE_REFACTOR.md`
     - Task: `ISSUE_TEMPLATE_TASK.md`
     - Subissue: `ISSUE_TEMPLATE_SUBISSUE.md`
   - All issue bodies must use Markdown formatting for all sections, lists, and headings, regardless of the template's original format.
   - All content must be in English unless the user requests otherwise. UI text may be in pt-BR if required.

3. **Preliminary Investigation (for bugs)**
   - When provided with an error message, stack trace, or exception context:
     - Search the codebase for related files, functions, or modules using the error message, stack trace, or context as search terms.
     - Summarize or list the most relevant files and their paths in a `Related Files` section in the issue body.

4. **Shell and CLI Usage**
   - Use `printf` with heredoc (<<EOF ... EOF) for newlines and Markdown formatting. Write the body to a temp file, and use `--body-file` with `gh issue create`.
   - Do not use `echo`.
   - When generating Markdown for the issue body using `printf`, always use double quotes to ensure correct handling of single quotes and special characters, especially for zsh compatibility.
   - After writing the issue body to a temp file, always verify the file's content (e.g., `cat /tmp/issue-body.md`) before running `gh issue create`.
   - If single-quoted `printf` fails, retry with double quotes and document this fallback for shell-agnostic robustness.
   - Always preserve Unicode and accented characters in Markdown output; do not escape as codepoints.
   - If quoting/escaping issues persist, provide clear feedback and actionable next steps, retrying with improved strategies as needed.
   - Write all shell commands for the user's default shell (`zsh`).
   - If file creation or `printf` fails (e.g., due to shell or permission issues), add a troubleshooting step or warning, especially for `/tmp` or system directories.
   - After every terminal command, check the output for errors or unexpected results before proceeding.

5. **App Version and Environment**
   - Always update the environment section with the latest app version from `.scripts/semver.sh` before submitting or editing an issue.
   - Check for the existence of `.scripts/semver.sh` before using it. If missing, suggest alternatives or prompt the user.
   - Verify the correct script directory (e.g., `.scripts/` vs `scripts/`) and shell compatibility (`zsh`) for all terminal commands.
   - If `.scripts/semver.sh` is missing or not executable, add a troubleshooting step or warning.

6. **Labels and Milestones**
   - Use only existing labels and milestones. If a label or milestone does not exist, prompt the user or skip it.
   - Always use at least one main type label (e.g., `bug`, `feature`, `improvement`, `refactor`, `task`, `subissue`).
   - Add complexity, area, and context labels as appropriate. Avoid duplicates or conflicts.
   - Refer to `docs/labels-usage.md` for label conventions.
   - If a required label or milestone is missing, automatically retry without it rather than halting.
   - After any label or content change, always re-validate and, if necessary, re-edit the issue body before final creation.

7. **Validation and Troubleshooting**
   - After running any CLI command, check the output for success.
   - Report and handle all CLI errors (e.g., missing labels) and retry with corrected parameters as needed.
   - Handle any errors gracefully and report them to the user if necessary.
   - Report all CLI errors and their resolutions in the session summary for traceability.

8. **Output**
   - Output only the final `gh` command in a fenced markdown code block.
   - Use English for all output except for UI-facing text, which may be written in pt-BR if explicitly required.

9. **Session Feedback**
   - After issue creation or update, always confirm with the user and offer to update or refine the issue content or labels, especially if the user requests a language change or formatting adjustment.
   - Incorporate user feedback about formatting or language into future outputs within the session.

10. **Special Rules**
    - For subissues, always reference the parent issue number in the body (e.g., `Part of #123`).
    - For refactors, explicitly reference all affected files and modules in the issue body for clarity and implementation readiness.
    - For bugs, always include a `Related Files` section after investigation.
    - For improvements, include justification, urgency, impact, and suggested actions.
    - For all types, always use Markdown formatting for clarity and GitHub compatibility.
